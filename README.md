# Playground
A personal monorepo for small fun side projects, more like a portfolio if you'd like.

## Projects
- Links will be added here as projects are generated

## Notes
- Each project lives in `/projects/<project-name>`
- Keep secrets out of git (use `.env` files, which are ignored by `.gitignore`)
